# Tensor Products in Lorentz- and SU(2)-Group

This _Mathematica_ notebook features overloaded CirclePlus and CircleTimes operators, do obtain irreducible representations of products of the Lorentz- or SU(2) group.

For example you can find the Lorentz and spin decomposition of the Rarita Schwinger field

>[In] (1⨁0) ⊗ 1/2  
>[Out] 1/2 ⨁ 1/2 ⨁ 3/2

>[In] {1/2, 1/2} ⊗ ({1/2, 0} ⨁ {0, 1/2})  
>[Out] {0, 1/2} ⨁ {1/2, 0} ⨁ {1/2, 1} ⨁{1, 1/2}
